Learning Project "Entity Comparator"
====================================
Motivation
------------------------------------
I have started with this project not for its functionality but to acquire knowledge and practice my skills in several fields:
- Android in general
- Kotlin
- Gradle
- Git
- Clean Architecture

Description
------------------------------------
This app lists and compares different "entities" regarding their "physical quantities."

For example it might offer a list of "entity types" like country, device, ... 
Then the user might choose "country" and compare every entry with Germany regarding their area. 
How often does Germany fit inside the countries listed?

It might also compare the power consumption of a "laptop" in the "device" list 
with all entities having the "power" quantity, whether inside "devices" or not.
